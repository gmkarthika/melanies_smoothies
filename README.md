✔️ Build a smoothie
Users select ingredients from dropdowns.

✔️ Submit an order
The app writes the order into a Snowflake table (smoothies.public.orders).

✔️ View order history
The app reads from Snowflake and displays past orders.

✔️ Update order status
Mark orders as filled / unfilled.

✔️ Use Snowflake features
Like UDFs, hashing, secure views, and Streamlit widgets.
